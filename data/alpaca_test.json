Making decisions involves more than just rational thought and logic, it also involves emotion. In fact, emotion has been found to play a crucial role in decision-making. Emotions are a powerful force that can both help and hinder the decision-making process. On one hand, emotions can influence an individual's thought process and can help them make decisions that would not have been possible without them. For example, emotions such as compassion or empathy can lead to decisions that are more beneficial to society, as opposed to decisions made without such emotions. On the other hand, emotions can also lead to decisions that are not in the best interest of an individual or society, such as decisions motivated by fear or anger. It is important, therefore, to use emotions judiciously and consider both the positive and negative effects of emotions when making decisions. By understanding the role of emotion in decision-making, an individual can make decisions that are more informed and wise."

Meanwhile, increased consolidation, automation of processes, and better access to data have helped them stay afloat. Innovation and creativity have been the cornerstones of survival and growth of many businesses during this period.

The Earth’s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources."
