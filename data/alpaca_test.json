It involves forming questions, conducting research, and constructing hypotheses that can be tested. Once hypotheses have been generated, they can be tested in a controlled environment, such as a laboratory setting, or in real-world scenarios. Data acquired from testing is used to refine and extend the initial hypotheses. The process is repeated as necessary until a satisfactory solution to the problem is reached. The scientific method can be used to solve difficult problems by applying its rigorous and systematic approach to gathering evidence and exploring data-driven solutions."

After the API has been designed it must be implemented on a development or production-ready server, depending on the user’s needs. This requires configuring the server environment and applying the appropriate security measures for any data or operations normally exposed to the public. Finally, the API must be tested to ensure both functional and non-functional requirements are met. This includes testing every endpoint and automated testing of certain scenarios and edge cases. Once the tests have been completed the API can be deployed and released to the public."
