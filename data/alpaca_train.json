Carbohydrates also have a role in helping to control blood sugar levels, which is important for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing or managing diabetes. Additionally, they provide dietary fiber which helps to improve digestion and promote a healthy gut. The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed is essential, as consuming too much can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Choosing complex carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, instead of simple carbohydrates that are found in processed and refined foods, can help to provide essential vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.

Only 10% of adults 18-30 reported using mobile phones to take pictures, suggesting that this is not a primary use of the device.\n\nOverall, the survey results suggest that communication is still the primary use of mobile phones among adults between the ages of 18 and 30.

Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects not only our environment, but also our health. From our oceans to our landfills, plastic pollution is becoming increasingly pervasive and is destroying our planet. \n\nPlastic production involves many toxins which are hazardous to our environment and health. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to these toxins can lead to severe health problems. Additionally, plastic pollution is not biodegradable and takes years to break down. It is estimated that a single plastic bottle takes 450 years to completely decompose. This means that our planet is continuously accumulating waste that could have been prevented. \n\nIt is time for us to make a change now. We can all start by doing our part and reducing our plastic usage. Here are a few ways we can achieve this: 1) Avoid drinking from single-use plastic water bottles. 2) Utilize reusable bags for grocery shopping. 3) Choose items with minimal plastic packaging and wrapping. 4) Recycle whenever possible. \n\nIf we all take the time to make small, conscious changes in our daily lives, it’ll be easier to create a sustainable future. Let’s all make a pledge to reduce our plastic usage and work together to save the environment. \n\nThank you for your time."
